-Recommendations for a better usage:

	If the results are too big to display in normal font size, press button start
	or try the tty terminal mode.

	For a large formula or a big matrix use the script mode, 
	is less tedious correct the values.

	The command clear, clear all previous operations, asignations, results and clear the graph area
	except the script mode.

	There is two ways to use draw button.
	Example:
		draw(sin(x)) 
		enter
	or
		sin(x)
		draw
		enter
	
	Don't forget, there is special funtions for matrix operations like dot, inv.
	For matirx operations isn't are equal a*b that dot(a,b) or a^-1 and inv(a)
